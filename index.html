                    From a young age I was interested in computers and Technologies. As I grew up, I started playing video games and back in my head I always wondered how is it that I press the 'W' key and my player in the monitor starts moving forward. I really found all these technologies very fascinating and overwhelming. Well some of my questions got answered by my mentor, some by my teachers and mostly by the power of Interent.

                    I am a problem solver, its my job to figure out solutions to problems no matter how complex they may get. I am well aware of both my strenghths and weaknesses. When learning something, I dedicate myself comletely to it and try to be as much clear as possible with the base concepts and fundamentals first. This applies not just to programming but in other areas too. I dont just learn something to move on form it but tend to use my knowledge to my advantage and bring up smart and out of the box innovative solutions for the probems. So when I commit to doing something I will get it done by any means that is legitimately possible. Below are some of the benefits of working with me.

                    The projects I have listed below are some of the major milestones in my programming journey. As I mentioned in my story section, I learned this fairly quickly that the real world doesn't need any toy projects. So, I always try to build something meaningful that has pretty good use practically and quite fun to build and work on. Take a look at some of my projects and dont forget to check out the learnings and summary tabs to know more about each project.

                                        One of my very first project. Before this I build quite a handful of small projects and scripts. After that I started learning a few libraries in python and soon Tkinter became one of my favourites. I liked to build things that can be shown and easily used. So I tried building a macro calculator first which made me comfortable with the library, and then I moved on to building this project. FLAMES is one of the simplest yet very fun projects I ever built.

Always interested in making games, I decided to make a simple browser game with the new technologies I learnt. And in the process I also wanted to learn HTML 5 Canvas and how to use it to make real working games.

                                        Ever since learning Javascript, I wanted to try it out in real world and applying my knowledge to bring up something useful. So I borrowed the idea from one of my friends and tried to understand the project and its details from him. I did quite some research on the using the correct formulas and giving the nearest accurate result. Also in this project, I learned how to build responsive websites and make them compatible with almost any device without loosing the quality of UI/UX and compromising any features.

                                        One of my most ambitious and lenghtiest projects, this was also my Graduation Project. During my final year of graduation, I wanted to build something which can be scalable, useful and very practical solution to a real world problem. I opted for a organisation that was heavily relied on logistics and pretty much dependant on its data to fullfill its day to day processes. And the need for data organisation and retention would be a huge plus for them. This project also helped me learn many new concepts about Django framework as well as many backend concpets, along with surrounding skills like how to structure a project and design data models. I really worked hard on this project but unfortunately due to COVID-19, I was not in a position to contact the company heads so I was not able to take this project any further and implement this in the organisation. Although I did finish the coding and was ready for production but at last I didnt had the fundings to make a full fledged web-app out of it which could live on a server and offer to fullfill the vision I had when I started building this.

                                As a kid I was always curious and very interested to solve problems in a different way and approach them in a way that makes it easier to understand and deal with. While credits to my mom for this. As I grew up, I developed a keen interest in computers and ofcourse that was because I loved playing video games. But thats when I got this urge to know how these things are actually made.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">Building a BASE</div>
                                During schooling, I always opted for subjects that were more related to computers and technology. I was introduced with HTML and basic computer knowledge in my high school (8th -10th). Later in my  secondary and senior secondary (11th & 12th), I opted for Informatics Practices in which I was introduced with my very first programming language, which was JAVA. Although it was not very thorough with the language but I really made a strong base with the programming concepts and algorithms. With that knowledge I got interested to learn more, but didnt get the opportunity to study CSE in any of the prestigious colleges here in India be it IIT, NIT, BITs etc. So I left that and got into something that at that time I thought was best for me that was B.F.Tech form NIFT.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">Why NIFT?</div>
                                If you dont know what B.F.Tech is or what NIFT is, I will try to summarise it for you. Basically, its a managerial degree combined with technical knowledge and soft skill enhancement to have a more practical approach in the real world scenarios generally focused in Design and Fashion industry but the approach can be applied in any situation of your life. I learnt a lot from this phase of my life. It made me a more confident person and gave me the tools to deal with any problem more efficiently and effectively.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">College Lessons</div>
                                Now I was not just learning life lessons form my college, infact I got interested into web design and development here in college only. I got introduced with design principles, color wheel, golden ratio, geometrical concepts, UI/UX and most importantly how and when to apply which knowledge and skill to crack a problem or design a creative solution. And here is where I got introduced with languages like languages like CSS and Python. Then I started learning more and more about Python in particular by my own as the sessions from my college were not enough for me.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">I will become a Programmer</div>
                                Python was the first programming language which I learned properly. I found about online learning platforms like <span class="highlight-text">Udemy</span>  and <span class="highlight-text">Coursera</span> during this time (2018). I invested more time to fully understand the language along with deeper programming concepts and more complex and real problems. The next year I got fully engaged in making projects using python and as a proud learner showing off them to my friends and family. Well, least did I knew that no one was interested in some toy projects and how a product's mechanism or code works and how big of an achievements they really were to me. Little disheartened but not all hopes lost.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">The Boon of Internet</div>
                                Well internet has always been by my side, sometimes it guides me and sometimes it simply motivates me in ways I never imagined. So one fine evening I got recommended this video titled <a class="target-btn" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiKK04Ht8QI">"Don't be a programmer"</a>, and I didnt knew how youtube knew how I was feeling or so I thought, and then I watched the video and it completely changed my perspective towards programming. I knew where I would fit in this puzzle of a world, I knew exactly what I had to do to get to become what I aspire for.
                            </div>                             
                            
                            <div class="blog-content-para">
                                <div class="blog-para-head">Becoming a Programmer</div>
                                A quest for becoming the best of me began. With new found meaning of who I want to be, I really got serious about it and the journey began. Well it was a hard journey from the start. As I was learning all by my own with no one to help me if I was stuck in my code, I would have to decode my code manually. Sometimes I just called it off and let it go and sometimes I stuck to it for days, weeks even months to solve a problem. Sometimes the bugs were silly and sometimes they were unimaginably difficult to even find, solving them used to be like a dream. Talking about dreams, yes I have found solution to the bugs in my code in my dreams as I used to be so engrossed in them. Well then came my old friend-cum-mentor-cum-guide "<span class="highlight-text">THE INTERNET</span>". So I learned how to <span class="highlight-text">Google</span> things and read answers form <span class="highlight-text">StackOverflow</span> pretty early in my journey to becomming a programmer. These are pretty normal and basic things that happens with every programmer but in my case I learned them in the hard way.
                            </div>

                                <div class="blog-para-head">Real Programming</div>
                                When I became pretty comfortable with programming and got some confidence to build anything that I could imagine. I took up some very serious projects and took them as my internship projects. In that way I would be working with a deadline to finish the project and finish them in time. The only problem with this idea was that I never anticipated the fact that coding a project is just the small part in building a project. There are many other phases to developing a real scalable project. One of which is to present it to people who dont understand programming and really have no interest in your ideas and how it was made and why is it so difficult to bringing an idea to life. My grades fell drastically.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">The Final Test</div>
                                Regardless of my setback, I refused to give up on my project and extended my project in the next internship. For my graduation project, I opted for a company that could have potential flaws in their working methodologies and so that I could come up with a solution to solve their problems. And learning from my mistakes, I decided to build a solution that could be useful, user friendly and easy to understand & presentable to the masses at the same time. Well here is where I built the <span class="highlight-text">"Triburg Web"</span> project, one of my most complicated and difficult project not only from coding perspective but from learning and presentation perspective as well. You can know more about the learnings and project details in the "Projects" section.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">What am I now?</div>
                                During lockdown, I engaged myself into learning something that I wanted to do for a very long time, <span class="highlight-text">Web Development</span>. So I started learning web technologies and especially JavaScript. Well I must say I found Javascript to be equally fun and interesting to learn as was with Python. I picked up the language pretty fast as I was clear with the programming concept and basics. But I wanted to master JavaScript, so I preffered a Udemy course for this, <a class="target-btn" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/">The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!</a> by <span class="highlight-text">Jonas Schmedtmann</span>. I was almost complete with the course by October and only the final project was left but then the course was updated with latest and new concepts of the language. At first I was very disappointed, as I didn't wanted to restart the course from the beginning but I stayed true to my goal becoming the master of the language, so I decided to restart the course from the beginning and learn all the new things as much as I could. After 3 months, I am glad to say that I restarted the course and it really helped my coding style and all my base concepts about the language are more clear. Now I can say I have a pretty strong grasp over the language but still got a lot more to learn.

                                <div class="blog-para-head">What's Next?</div>
                                As soon as I will finish the course I will start learning <span class="highlight-text">MERN</span> stack. As I said earlier, I dont want to build toy apps, I believe learning can only be at its peak when you pick up something that is almost impossible for you to achieve with the knowledge you have and only then you will find ways to approach and solve the problem that are really out of the box, innovative and creative.
